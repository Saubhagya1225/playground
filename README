A place to play programming.

In this repository I'll save all my solutions for site as Project Euler, URI,
SPOJ and etc. Most of those sites have problem that follows the structure of
the programming contest runned by ACM for students around the world. I used to
attend those competitions at my student age, but I still playing and having
some fun.

Most of the problem folow the sdtin/stdout programming contest standard. So you
can run it manually by running something like these commands:

    $ g++ 1003.cpp
    $ a.out < int.txt > out.txt


            Running your code


There is a virtual machine ready to run those problems. To lauch it run:

    $ vagrant up # to lauch the machine
    $ vagrant ssh # to ssh to the machine

There is a boilerplate command to create the folder structure that this project
folows. Its syntax is:

    $ new-problem problem-code [language-extension]

The problem structure is:

    └─┬ PROGRAMMING CONTEST SITE
      └─┬ COMPETITION NAME (if there is the concept of competition)
          └─┬ COMPETITION ROUND NAME (if there is the concept of competition round)
            └── PROBLEM-CODE.{c,cpp,go,js,py}
            └── in.txt
            └── out.txt
            └── problem.txt

Following this structure, you will be able to run your code, in all supported
language with just one command:

    $ marathon

This command already tests Go, Python, C, C++ and NodeJS code. It also checks
lint for all those languages.
