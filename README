A place to play programming.

In this repository I'll save all my solutions for site as Project Euler, URI,
SPOJ and etc. Most of those sites have problem that follows the structure of
the programming contest runned by ACM for students around the world. I used to
attend those competitions at my student age, but I still playing and having
some fun.

There is a virtual machine ready to run those problems. To lauch it run:

    vagrant up # to lauch the machine
    vagrant ssh # to ssh to the machine

There is a command to boilerplate the solution. Its syntax is:

    new-problem problem-code [language-extension]

The problem structure is:

    └─┬ PROGRAMMING CONTEST SITE
      └─┬ COMPETITION (if there is the concept of competition)
        └── PROBLEM-CODE.{c,cpp,go,js,py}
        └── in.txt
        └── out.txt
        └── problem.txt

To check if the solutions is correct run the command:

    marathon

This command already tests Go, Python, C, C++ and NodeJS code.
